STRUCTURE
m5                      Structure string. Several available options are given at the end of this file
n/a                     If Structure = 'ud': the full path to the xyz file you want to use
n/a                     If Structure = 'ud': the name of the structure (for output purposes only)

EVALUATION METHOD
2                       1 : Overlapping sphere approach (OSA), 2 : Grid point approach (GPA)

FOR GPA ONLY
1.20                    Probe radius for the evaluation of the accessible porosity
2                       Grid point initialization. 1 : grid points per unit cell vector, 2 : grid points per A (uniform grid)
20                       If initialization = 1: 3 integers for the number of grid points along each cell vector
