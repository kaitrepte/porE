# porE
PORosity Evaluation tool  

Main developer: 

* Kai Trepte 

Sidekick:  

* Sebastian Schwalbe 

Coding language: FORTRAN   

## Installation
To compile the code, do

	cd src/

	make

	cd ..

## Running the code
There are three calculations types one can choose from:

* OSA : Overlapping sphere approach. Calculates the porosity via two-body overlaps of spheres.
* GPA : Grid point approach. Void and accessible porosity are calculated using a grid in the unit cell.
* PSD : Pore size distribution. Using a Monte-Carlo scheme, the pore size distribution is calculated.

To run the code, go to the *run* folder. The file run.sh includes these options:

* porE: This is the standard code. Includes OSA, and the standard GPA
* porE_subgrid: A modified, much faster version of the GPA (GPA_sub-grid). Includes OSA as well.
* porE_window:  Same as pore_subgrid, but including an evaluation of the pore windows. Uses the output of get_PSD (see below) as input
* get_PSD: Analyze the PSD in any MOF. One needs to be careful with choosing proper numerical parameters

Just uncomment the corresponding line in run.sh and comment out the others.

Usage: First, modify the input file (input_porosity OR input_PSD) according to the system you want to investigate. For pore_window, one first needs an output_PSD file which is generated by executing get_PSD. Beware that for any given structure, this only needs to be done once. For the given structures, one can copy the corresponding files from results/results_PSD.

Then, type
```should work with all shells
./run.sh
```

## Additional information
Limitations: Some elements regarding their vdW radii are not implemented yet. 
More will be done in the future.

The basic outline of the porE code and its applications are summarized in
